This is a Java program that implements a simple game of rock-paper-scissors. 
The program prompts the user to enter their choice of rock, paper, or scissors 
and then generates a random choice for the computer. 
The program then determines the winner based on the game's rules and displays the result.

The program includes a play() method that runs the game in a loop until the user decides to quit
by pressing enter without entering any input. 
The getWinner() method determines the winner based on the game's rules 
and returns a string indicating the winner or a tie.

This version of the program also includes a score tracker that keeps track 
of the number of wins for the user and the computer.
